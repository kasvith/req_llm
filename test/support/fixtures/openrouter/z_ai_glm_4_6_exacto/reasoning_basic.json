First, I'll multiply the 10 part of 12 by 7: `10 * 7 = 70`.\n2.  Then, I'll multiply the remaining 2 by 7: `2 * 7 = 14`.\n3.  Finally, I'll add those two results together: `70 + 14 = 84`.",

I can't just give the answer. I need to explain *how* I got it, and the explanation should be concise and easy to follow, mimicking how a person might mentally do it.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming - Mental Math Strategies for `12 * 7`:**\n    *   **Strategy 1: Decomposition/Breaking it down.** This is the most common and intuitive way for most people.\n        *   Break `12` into `10 + 2`.\n        *   Multiply each part by `7`.\n        *   `10 * 7 = 70`. (This is super easy, just adding a zero).\n        *   `2 * 7 = 14`. (A basic multiplication fact).\n        *   Add the results: `70 + 14 = 84`. (Simple addition).\n        *   *Verdict:* This is an excellent choice. It's clear, logical, and very common. It perfectly fits the \"brief internal thinking\" requirement.\n\n    *   **Strategy 2: Doubling.**\n        *   `12 * 7` is the same as `12 * (2 + 2 + 3)`... no, that's getting complicated.\n        *   How about using `12 * 2 = 24`? `12 * 4` would be `24 * 2 = 48`. Then I need `12 * 3`... `12 * 2 = 24`, plus `12` is `36`. So `48 + 36`. `48 + 30 = 78`, `78 + 6 = 84`.\n        *   *Verdict:* This works, but it's more steps and more complex. It's not as \"brief\" or \"internal\" as the first strategy. I'll keep it as a backup but prioritize Strategy 1.\n\n    *   **Strategy 3: Standard Multiplication (like on paper).**\n        *   ```\n            12\n          x  7\n          ----\n          ```\n        *   `7 * 2 = 14`.

Add the carried `1`, which is `8`.\n        *   Write down `8`.\n        *   Result: `84`.\n        *   *Verdict:* This is also a valid way to think. It's very algorithmic. It's a strong contender for \"internal thinking\" because many people were taught this and can visualize it.\n\n    *   **Strategy 4: Using known facts.**\n        *   I know `12 * 12 = 144` (from the \"dozens\" concept).\n        *   `12 * 12 = 144`.\n        *   `12 * 11 = 144 - 12 = 132`.\n        *   `12 * 10 = 132 - 12 = 120`.\n        *   Now I need `12 * 7`. I can go down from `12 * 10`.\n        *   `12 * 9 = 120 - 12 = 108`.\n        *   `12 * 8 = 108 - 12 = 96`.\n        *   `12 * 7 = 96 - 12 = 84`.\n        *   *Verdict:* This is迂回. It works, but it's definitely not \"brief\". It's a good way to check an answer or for someone who *really* thinks in big visuals, but it's too long for this request.\n\n3.  **Selecting the Best Strategy and Structuring the Output:**\n    *   Strategy 1 (Decomposition) and Strategy 3 (Standard Algorithm) are the strongest candidates. They are both brief and reflect common mental processes.\n    *   I'll lead with the decomposition method because it feels more like \"mental math\" and less like \"renaacting schoolwork\" for many people. It's about breaking a harder problem into easier ones.\n    *   I'll write it out in a clear, step-by-step format.\n\n4.  **Drafting the Final Response (incorporating the \"brief\" and \"thinking\" aspects):**\n\n    *   **Start with the answer.** Get straight to the point. `12 * 7 = 84`.\n    *   **Create a section for the internal thinking.** A heading like \"Internal Thinking\" works well.\n    *   **Describe the chosen method.** I'll use the decomposition method.\n    *   **Step 1:** Break down the `12`. \"I'll break the 12 into a 10 and a 2, since multiplying by 10 is easy.\"\n    *   **Step 2:** Calculate the two parts. \"First, 10 * 7 = 70.\"\n    *   **Step 3:** \"Next, 2 * 7 = 14.\" (This is a basic multiplication I know).\n    *   **Step 4:** Combine the results. \"Finally, I'll add those two results together: 70 + 14 = 84.\"\n\n5.  **Review and Refine:**\n    *   Does it solve the problem? Yes, `12 * 7 = 84`.\n    *   Does it show internal thinking? Yes, it explains the steps.\n    *   Is it brief? Yes, it's four short sentences. It avoids jargon and gets right to the point.\n    *   The tone is conversational and reflective (\"I'll break,\" \"I'll add\"), which fits the \"internal thinking\" prompt perfectly.",
