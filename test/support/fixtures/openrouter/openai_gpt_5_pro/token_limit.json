            "content": "It was the kind of wind that peeled paint from doors and prayers from lips, the kind of wind that had a smell like iron and green shoots ripped up by roots. Lysa pulled her scarf over her nose as she climbed the edge of the cliff. The lighthouse behind her hissed and spat its flame into the black. Through the spitting spray and the hum of the lantern glass, she heard it: a low sound like a plucked string, then a second note, and then an entire chorus, so far away it felt like memory. Dragonsong.\n\nShe had heard about it her entire life and never once believed the cadence was more than story. Her grandmother, who had a jaw like a tool chest and a heart like the inside of an apple, had said: Remember, child. The dragons sing the weather into place. If they stop, the world untethers. Lysa had always laughed, and then she had become a mapmaker, because she wanted the world to be a thing that could be folded and placed in a pocket and understood.\n\nOn that night, with the wind trying to take her, she heard the dragons’ song falter. The notes frayed like a rope rubbed against too many rocks. Then there was a shadow inside the dark. It did not have a shape first; it had a presence, like someone standing on the other side of a door. The presence became a streak of black that turned gray at the edges and then glowed. The glow flickered purple and copper. The streak stuttered and stuttered until it began to fall.\n\nLysa forgot to be afraid until the cliff beneath her boots trembled. Something hit the cliffside so hard the stones popped from their mortar. A spray of shard-sharp slate peppered her jacket. She braced, coughed, and slid on her backside down the scrub path to the rocky shelf below.\n\nHe was there, tangled like a sail in the skein of a thorn bush, his left wing shredded in three places, his right foreleg bent almost double. The scales beneath the blood were not coin-bright, not fairytale. They were rock-colored, as if he had grown from the cliff itself: slate and basilisk green, flecked with mica. He had no spines down his back. He had a ridge like a river’s undercurrent. He smelled like the sea when it consents to be gentle for an hour. He watched her with one eye—a tilt of polished stone, clever and furious and very, very tired.\n\n“You are not supposed to be here,” he said. He did not move his mouth when he spoke. The words slid into her head like steady hands, but the voice was not a command; it was a fact, made almost tender by the world’s insistence that it be true.\n\n“I live here,” Lysa said, because the other answer would have been: I think I was supposed to be here. I think I have been waiting for this.\n\n“Then you heard,” he said, and now there was a bite in the music of his thoughts. “The line snapped. The songline under the western current. Biter’s Hook. Someone cut it.”\n\n“Someone can cut a song?” Lysa asked.\n\n“You make your roads into maps, don’t you?” he said. “Your lines change the lay of the land for your feet. We make air into ropes. We make time into water. We braid things. You cut braids. If you cut them in the wrong place, your hair falls out and you shiver in winter without knowing why.”\n\nShe stared at the cut, the three long tears dangling like unspooled silk from his wing. He was the size of the lighthouse if the lighthouse had crouched. “You’re bleeding,” she said, as if he might have missed the fact.\n\nHis lip, whatever passed for a lip, quirked in a way that read as humor. “You are clever. May I die on your cliff?”\n\n“No,” she said. “Because then I would have to explain it to my grandmother, and she has opinions about the proper use of a cliff.”\n\nHe made a sound not unlike the hiss of the lantern when storm-lashed. “What is your name, cliff’s daughter?”\n\n“Lysa.”\n\n“Ly-saaa,” he tried. “Little winter leaf.”\n\n“Listen,” she said, surprising herself by grabbing a torn fold of his wing between her hands to examine the wound. “This thorn bush is going to keep you stitched to the ground until the gulls name you theirs. Can you move?” The blood under her palms was warm and slick, the scales surprisingly soft along the seam.\n\n“I can sing it light,” he said. “But the song is wrong.”\n\n“Then don’t sing. Just…hold very still.” She pulled the thorny branches away from his wing and out from under his belly where they had wedged. He lifted with a careful, impossible delicacy, as if a mountain had considered being airborne.\n\nIn the lighthouse there were old tools that had lost their names, and Lysa knew them all. She ran inside and came back with a coil of rope, a handful of curved needles, twine, a bucket of saltwater, and a jar of thistle oil. He watched her with both eyes now, the other one heavy-lidded. “You are going to stitch me?” he asked, something like amusement curving the thought.\n\n“You don’t get to laugh,” she said, and sewed. He hissed once and then grew very still. She scrubbed the blood away with the salted water and oiled the wounds. When she finished, she stood on toes and smoothed the line of his jaw. Up close she could see the hairline seams between scales. Between them, a faint light moved, as if something under his skin was thinking with fire.\n\n“You have a singer’s hands,” he said after what might have been an hour, or the entire night. The wind had not changed. The lighthouse glass stuttered. “Or a thief’s. But your stitches are true.”\n\n“I am a mapmaker,” she said. “I know the quickest way between two points is a kindness to hurt.”\n\nHe lowered his head to the rock. “I have a name I was given. My nest named me Caurim because I hatched on the day the river ran backwards and the sky tasted like copper. But the name I carry when I bind the weather is older. It lasts through storms and regrowths. You can’t say it unless you’d like your teeth to shake loose.”\n\n“What should I call you?” she asked.\n\n“Caurim is fine,” he said. His not-mouth twisted again. “Unless we find out you have teeth to spare.”\n\nThe world beyond the cliff was a churn. The northern lights had wandered down wrong, dipped their lace into the waves, and the horizon went cottonwood white and then black as a bucket. It felt, to Lysa—who had learned to climb lighthouses with the surety of gulls—that the world had tilted two degrees. “You said something broke.”\n\nCaurim turned his head slightly. “The Accord is woven into the songlines. Humans agreed to make your houses in the soft places and call them yours. Dragons agreed to sing the seasons into water and wind. But not all soft places are in the same place, and not all seasons are agreeable. We built a loom out of air and geometry. Your first kings stood in a circle while we sang. That was then. Now someone is unbraiding the world in a way that suggests they did not promise to share it. Or they did and forgot.”\n\n“How does one forget a promise like that?” Lysa asked.\n\n“You live long enough that only things that burn you stay,” Caurim said. “Or you live short enough that only things you can hold in your hand matter. And promises are like songs. If you don’t sing them, they go somewhere else to be remembered.”\n\nHe heaved himself up, fought his way to standing, and looked over his shoulder at his wing. “Your stitches will earn you stories,” he said. “Will you of the cliff walk under me?”\n\n“Like a pet?” Lysa raised an eyebrow.\n\n“Like a companion,” he said. “I am going to the central nest. We are not supposed to carry humans unless something is coming undone. Something is coming undone. If you come, bring your maps. The world is going to need them.”\n\n“My grandmother—”\n\n“Is going to ask you to bring her back a dragon tooth and a story. She will claim she never wanted grandchildren though she has ten. She will tell you the pomegranates are not for you. But she will tuck bread into your pocket when she thinks your eyes are elsewhere. I can see her in your face.”\n\n“Will you fit through the lighthouse door?” Lysa asked dryly.\n\n“My teeth are all quite attached to me,” Caurim said, and when he laughed, the cliff",
